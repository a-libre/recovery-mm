                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>There's a pattern that runs through a lot of your drinking. You skipped being homecoming king. You felt like an impostor at the Holiday Inn bar in Sarajevo. You chose Russian and niche journalism beats. You ghost Slack announcements and invitations. You drink alone in your office where no one's watching.</p>
                    <p>The common thread: anticipating evaluation makes you want to disappear.</p>
                    <p>This isn't social anxiety in the clinical sense—you can do panels, you can moderate forums, you've done war reporting. It's more specific: when you forecast that people might judge you and find you inadequate, you either avoid the situation or chemically dismiss the audience. Drinking alone meant you could feel adequate for a few hours because you'd eliminated the evaluators.</p>
                    <p>The cruel irony: hiding the drinking meant living in constant fear of a different kind of exposure. You went from avoiding professional evaluation to hiding something actually shameful. The secrecy became its own source of the inadequacy you were trying to escape.</p>
                    <p>What changed at that 40-year college reunion: everyone's just aging and muddling through. The evaluation you forecasted wasn't there. It rarely is. The grading system mostly exists in the forecasting, not in reality.</p>
                    <p>The question for recovery isn't "how do I prove I'm adequate?" It's "what if this was never about being graded?" Most situations where you think you're being evaluated are actually just opportunities to participate. The Slack post isn't an audition. The gathering isn't a test.</p>
                    <p>Drinking removed the imaginary audience. Recovery means realizing the audience was imaginary to begin with.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">The 4:55 Transition</h2>
                
                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>The dangerous time isn't 7 PM when you're already drinking. It's 4:55 when work officially ends and you haven't decided what evening-you is doing. There's no structure in that gap between day-mode and evening-mode.</p>
                    <p>You used to time your drive home from the East Bay so you could drink a bottle of wine before Jean got there. That was you filling the transition gap. Alcohol said "day's over, you can stop now." It worked as a transition ritual, just a destructive one.</p>
                    <p>The 5-8 PM urge cluster isn't about work stress peaking. It's about the transition having no alternative structure. When you were swimming every day up at Sea Ranch and doing the circuit workout consistently, the evening pattern looked different. The body moving at a specific time does part of the work that alcohol used to do.</p>
                    <p>Naltrexone fits here too. Not as a fail-safe for shaky moments, but as part of a daily transition ritual. Take it at 2 PM every day. That's early enough that it's not a referendum on whether you're "at risk" today—it's just what 2 PM means now.</p>
                    <p>The gym, the walk, the phone call to one person, the naltrexone at 2—these aren't exercises to try when motivated. They're infrastructure. Like brushing teeth. You don't wait to feel inspired about brushing teeth, you just have a time and place where it happens. Same with the transition out of work-mode.</p>
                    <p>The point isn't perfection, it's interrupting the autopilot that leads from "work's done" to "might as well stop at the store."</p>

                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>You've used this phrase in meetings: "I just want to get lost." It's not about getting high. It's about temporary relief from being Michael—senior journalist, husband, father of difficult son, competent 62-year-old.</p>
                    <p>When you drink alone in your office, you're not socializing or celebrating. You're sitting with vodka and maybe music, suspended. No one needs anything. No one's evaluating. You're completely off-duty. Not Michael Montgomery with reputation and responsibilities. Just... here.</p>
                    <p>The need itself is legitimate. The execution destroys trust.</p>
                    <p>Visible solitude: "I'm taking 15 minutes at 6:30, listening to jazz in my room." Jean knows where you are. You're not hiding. You come out 15 minutes later and you're present.</p>
                    <p>Secret amnesty: drinking alone and lying about it. Jean doesn't know where you really are. You come out hours later volatile or absent.</p>
                    <p>At 62, you're allowed to need space. You're not allowed to betray your wife to get it. The shift is making the need visible instead of secret. "I need 15 minutes alone" is an adult request. Hiding in your office drinking is the child's version of the same need.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Secrecy as Competence Protection</h2>
                
                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>You lied about debt early in your marriage. You've lied about drinking for years. You've swallowed professional resentments and smiled through feeling undervalued.</p>
                    <p>The pattern: you withhold anything that might make you look inadequate. If you're struggling financially, you're not a capable provider. If you're drinking too much, you're not in control. If you voice professional hurt, you're not the confident veteran.</p>
                    <p>Secrecy protects the competent-Michael image. The cost: you're managing two versions. External Michael (reliable, steady) and internal Michael (struggling, exhausted by the performance).</p>
                    <p>Jean asks "What else are you lying about?" She's not paranoid. She's responding to something missing. She knows when you're editing yourself. Every edit confirms: I can't fully trust him.</p>
                    <p>The solution isn't dumping every unflattering truth on her hoping for absolution. That's still about managing her opinion of you. The solution is smaller: "I almost didn't mention X because I worried it would make me look Y."</p>
                    <p>That sentence does two things: discloses the withheld thing, and names why you withheld it. It's not asking for forgiveness. It's showing you see the pattern and you're working on it.</p>
                    <p>You've spent decades thinking: honesty = exposure = looking inadequate. The reframe: honesty is competence. Being able to say "I struggled with this" is what people who've done real work sound like.</p>

                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>You studied Russian, chose narrow journalism beats, got into jazz deeply. Niches let you control the comparison set. In jazz, you're comparing yourself to other amateurs, not Miles Davis. In specialized reporting, you have authority.</p>
                    <p>This worked. It gave you confidence in spaces where you might've felt overwhelmed. But it also narrowed connection opportunities.</p>
                    <p>As you face retirement: do you want to be alone with your niches, or make them social?</p>
                    <p>Example: a listening salon. Three jazz tracks, 45 minutes total, invite a few people. You're not demonstrating expertise, you're curating something you think people will find interesting. That's a different stance.</p>
                    <p>You keep the mastery (you know jazz), you add people (you're not performing for them). Mastery meets community. Invite two, expect one. Keep it short enough to repeat. Quarterly, not monthly.</p>
                    <p>The story you've told yourself: "I'm into things other people aren't into, so I'm alone." Alternative story: "I'm into things that could become bridges if I design them that way."</p>
                    <p>The goal isn't becoming a social butterfly. It's stopping the default to isolation. Your drinking was isolating. Your recovery doesn't have to be.</p>

                    <p>You're 62. Jean's 70 and retired. You've been at CIR 16 years, in journalism 36. The next chapter is visible. You feel both excitement (financially secure, time ahead) and dread (what the hell do you do when you're not a working journalist?).</p>
                    <p>The trap: thinking of retirement as "activities." Golf, travel, tennis. Activities are fine but they don't replace identity.</p>
                    <p>You need roles, not just activities. A role has a recurring responsibility, a cadence, and a social component. Host of a quarterly salon. Doubles partner every Thursday. Moderator of a monthly journalism forum. Doesn't have to be ambitious.</p>
                    <p>Structureless freedom sounds good until three months in you realize you haven't talked to anyone outside your household in a week. For you, that's high-risk territory. Idle, alone, vacuum where "journalist Michael" used to be. Alcohol filled that vacuum before.</p>
                    <p>Your dad's model: after he quit drinking, AA became his structure. Meetings, sponsees, responsibilities. You don't need AA specifically, but you need something with the same function—a repeating rhythm that answers "what do I do on Thursdays?"</p>
                    <p>Roles are metronomes. When you have a beat, you're less likely to drift toward idle, alone, thinking about drinking.</p>

                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>When you're in awe—looking at something vast, old, strange—you're not thinking about whether you're adequate. You're not forecasting judgment. Your self-concern shrinks.</p>
                    <p>Research shows awe reduces "self-focus"—the loop about your own adequacy and standing. That loop is what feeds the audience problem. When you're caught in it, you're vulnerable. Alcohol promises to interrupt it. Awe actually does, without destroying the evening.</p>
                    <p>Three 12-15 minute walks per week at dusk, deliberately looking for awe. You live near Buena Vista Park. The Presidio, the Golden Gate when fog's rolling in, old Victorians on your block. These aren't hard to find in SF.</p>
                    <p>Dusk matters because it's the leading edge of the 5-8 window. If you're walking at 5:45, you're not home deciding whether to drink. If you're watching fog, you're not ruminating about work.</p>
                    <p>The walk doesn't cure the urge. It prevents the rumination that feeds the urge. You already use your body to prepare for panels (breathing, warm-ups). Same principle, different application.</p>

                    <p>Two-sleep rule: 48-hour delay plus tell one person. Text: "Testing thought popped up. 48-hour clock starts now." That's it. No explanation needed.</p>
                    <p>The point isn't debating whether you should test. The point is making the thought no longer secret. Testing thoughts rely on secrecy and speed. The 48 hours removes speed. The witness removes secrecy. At hour 47, it usually looks different.</p>
                    <p>If after 48 hours it still feels compelling, escalate: meeting, call someone, review your structure. But most testing thoughts don't survive two sleeps and one witness.</p>

                    <p>Compare to: come home, office, desk, "check email," feel pull, argue with yourself, lose argument, drive to store. That's the ambush. Your office is where you drank—it's the "den of destruction." Going there 5-7 PM is re-entering the scene.</p>

                <div class="insight" data-selectable="true">
                    <p>Oral naltrexone is pharmacology. It's also a daily oath.</p>
                    <p>Take it at 2 PM every day. When you swallow it, you're not just blocking opioid receptors. You're saying "I'm keeping the frame."</p>
                    <p>Not "preventing a relapse"—that keeps you in problem-space. "Keeping the frame" orients toward what you're building. The frame: I'm a man who doesn't drink. I'm 62, building post-career life, repairing my marriage, showing up.</p>
                    <p>Pair it with the 4:55 hand-off. Naltrexone at 2 (before danger window) + hand-off at 4:55 (danger window's edge). Two rituals, two bookends. The naltrexone sets the frame. The hand-off walks you through the window inside that frame.</p>
                    <p>You've taken it inconsistently before, as a fail-safe for shaky days. That's not how it works best. It works best non-negotiable, like brushing teeth. You don't wait to feel cavity-prone to brush teeth. You brush because you decided: that's part of who I am.</p>
                    <p>Same with naltrexone. You take it because you decided: I'm someone who keeps the frame.</p>
                    <p>Missed dose? Don't spiral. Take the next one, say "frame's back." Missed doses are data, not moral failures. They tell you: high-risk day, shore up other supports (meetings, texts, safe routes).</p>
