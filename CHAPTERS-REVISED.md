## Chapter 1: Being Seen vs The Audience Problem

**Core Insight:**

You skipped your homecoming king banquet. Not because you were sick or had a conflict—you just didn't want to go. You were in high school, and somehow the idea of standing in front of people while they looked at you felt unbearable. Fast forward decades: you're in Sarajevo, surrounded by seasoned war correspondents at the Holiday Inn bar, and that same feeling returns. "Who the fuck are you?" the voice asks. "You're not some veteran journalist. You don't belong here."

The audience problem isn't about actual people evaluating you—it's about the internal forecasting system that runs whenever exposure is possible. Your brain calculates: if I'm seen, I'll be graded. If I'm graded, I'll be found wanting. Better to opt out. Better to choose the niche over the mainstream, Russian language over the popular major, a narrow beat where you can be the expert rather than one journalist among many.

Alcohol became the chemical opt-out. When you drank alone in your office, you dismissed the audience entirely. No one was grading you. You could feel adequate—even king of the hill—for a few hours. The irony: you then had to hide the drinking, which meant living in constant fear of exposure. You were now being evaluated for something far more shameful than professional inadequacy.

Here's what shifts in recovery: you stop trying to prove and start trying to share. You stop performing and start participating. When your mind says "they'll think you're inadequate," you ask: "What if this is about connection, not evaluation?" The 40-year college reunion was instructive—everyone's aging, everyone's on a trajectory, and none of it really matters the way your mind insists it does. Your job isn't to audition for the role of "adequate person." It's to belong.

The audience problem shows up in Slack announcements you don't post, invitations you ghost, and meetings where you stay on mute. Each avoidance confirms the belief: I'm not ready to be seen. Recovery means testing that belief in small, deliberate doses. Not to "prove" you're worthy, but to discover that the grading system was a fiction all along.

## Chapter 2: The 4:55 Hand-Off (State Transition)

**Core Insight:**

The dangerous hour isn't 7 PM when you're already drinking. It's 4:55 PM when your official work hours end and you haven't yet decided who you are for the evening. You're neither day-self (evaluated, productive, on-task) nor evening-self (restorative, present, off-duty). You're in the gap, and the gap has no ritual.

This is why urges cluster between 5 and 8 PM. It's not that work stress is highest then—it's that the transition has no structure. When you were driving home from the East Bay office, you'd deliberately time it so you could drink a bottle of wine or champagne before Jean got home. You were filling the gap with a chemical hand-off. Alcohol did the work that a transition ritual should have done: it said, "Day is over. You can stop now."

The problem: alcohol's hand-off destroys the evening. You end up volatile, absent, ashamed. You need a sober hand-off that does three things: (1) speaks to your future self ("day is done"), (2) moves your body (10 minutes, non-negotiable), and (3) connects you to one other person (text, call, even just planning to). These three moves interrupt the autopilot that leads to the liquor store.

Your oral naltrexone belongs here, too. You've been taking it, but maybe not ritually. Tie it to 2 PM—early afternoon, before the danger window, when you're still day-self. Pair it with a mantra: "I'm keeping the frame." Not "I'm preventing a relapse," which keeps you in the problem. "I'm keeping the frame," which orients you toward who you want to be.

Rituals beat willpower because they move the body before the brain argues. If you wait until 5:15 PM to decide whether to drink, the urge has a 10-minute head start. If you have a 4:55 script—even a clumsy one—you short-circuit the decision tree. Your feet take you to the gym or the park or the phone before your mind says, "But actually, a drink would make this easier."

The hand-off doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be there.

## Chapter 3: "Getting Lost" as Amnesty

**Core Insight:**

You've said it in meetings, in sessions, in late-night journal entries: "I just want to get lost." It sounds like escape, and it is—but from what, exactly? You're escaping the relentless performance of being Michael: senior journalist, reliable husband, father of a volatile son, man who should have it together by 62. Drinking alone in your office wasn't about getting high. It was about temporary amnesty from every identity that carries a standard.

The dangerous thing about "getting lost" is that it feels deeply true. It's not a rationalization—it's a real need. You do need relief from role-demands. The question is: can you design amnesty that doesn't destroy your evening?

Think about what happens when you drink alone. You're not socializing. You're not celebrating. You're sitting in your room, vodka within reach, maybe listening to music, maybe staring at nothing. You're suspended. No one needs anything from you. No one can evaluate you. You're off-duty in the most complete way possible. For two hours, you're not Michael Montgomery, investigative journalist with awards and deadlines and a reputation. You're just… here. Alone. Ungraded.

Now imagine this: you tell Jean, "I'm taking a 15-minute quiet window at 6:30. I'll be listening to jazz in my room." You close the door. You sit. You listen. You're still off-duty, still ungraded, still relieved of identity-demands. But you've made it visible. Jean knows where you are. You're not hiding. When you come out 15 minutes later, you're present.

Visible solitude builds trust. Secret amnesty destroys it. The need is legitimate. The execution was broken.

Here's the shift: you stop treating "getting lost" as something shameful that requires secrecy. You start treating it as a valid recovery tool that requires boundaries. "I need 15 minutes alone" is an adult sentence. "I'm drinking in my room and lying about it" is a child's sentence. You're 62. You're allowed to need space. You're not allowed to betray your wife to get it.

## Chapter 4: Secrecy as Competence Protection

**Core Insight:**

You lied to Jean about going into debt early in your marriage. You lied about how much you were drinking for years. You've kept professional resentments to yourself, swallowed frustrations, and smiled through situations where you felt undervalued. The common thread: you withhold anything that might make you look less-than. If you say you're struggling financially, you're not a capable provider. If you admit you're drinking too much, you're not in control. If you voice professional hurt, you're not the confident veteran.

Secrecy, for you, is competence protection.

Here's the mechanism: your brain says, "If I tell the truth about [X], I'll look inadequate. If I look inadequate, I'll be rejected." So you protect the image. You keep things contained. You present the version of Michael that's holding it together. The cost: you're now managing two lives. The external Michael (competent, reliable, steady) and the internal Michael (struggling, drinking, exhausted by the performance).

Jean's radar is excellent. When she says "What else are you lying about?", she's not being paranoid—she's responding to the felt absence of full disclosure. She knows when you're editing. And every edit, no matter how small, confirms her fear: I can't fully trust him.

The solution isn't confession-as-catharsis, where you dump every unflattering truth in her lap and hope she'll absolve you. That's still about you. The solution is honesty-as-micro-practice. Ten seconds at a time. "I almost didn't mention [X] because I worried it would make me look [Y]." That sentence does two things: it discloses the withheld truth, and it names the protection mechanism. It says, "I'm working on this. I see the pattern."

You've spent decades equating honesty with exposure and exposure with inadequacy. The reframe: honesty is competence. The ability to say "I struggled with this" or "I'm working on that" is a mark of someone who's done real psychological work. Competent people don't hide their humanity—they integrate it.

Ten-second honesty push-ups. That's the training plan.

## Chapter 5: Niche → Social (Curate, Don't Perform)

**Core Insight:**

You studied Russian. You chose journalism beats that were narrow enough that you could be the expert. You've always been drawn to niche interests—not because you dislike people, but because niches let you control the comparison set. In jazz, you're comparing yourself to other amateur enthusiasts. In Slavic studies, you're comparing yourself to a small cohort. In investigative reporting on specific topics, you've built a domain where you have authority.

This strategy worked. It gave you confidence. It let you feel adequate in spaces where you might have felt overwhelmed. But it also narrowed connection opportunities. And as you approach retirement, the question becomes: do you want to spend the next chapter alone with your niches, or do you want to make your niches social?

Here's the model: a listening salon. You pick three jazz tracks—maybe 45 minutes total. You invite four to six people. You're not performing. You're not proving you know more about Chet Baker than everyone else. You're curating an experience. You're hosting curiosity. You're saying, "I think you'll find this interesting," not "Let me demonstrate my expertise."

The shift from niche-as-isolation to niche-as-social-infrastructure is subtle but crucial. You keep the mastery (you're not abandoning what you know). You add people (you're not performing for them). The result: mastery meets community. You get the confidence boost of being knowledgeable and the connection boost of being with others.

"Invite two, expect one" is the rule. Don't over-invest in the outcome. Make it short enough that it's repeatable. Quarterly is a cadence. Monthly might be too much. The goal isn't to become a social butterfly—it's to stop using niche interests as an excuse to avoid people.

You've told yourself the story: "I'm into things other people aren't into, so I'm alone." The revision: "I'm into things that could become bridges if I design them that way." The listening salon is a test case. If it works, you've found a template. If it doesn't, you try something else. But you stop defaulting to isolation.

## Chapter 6: Retirement Identity Portfolio (Roles > Activities)

**Core Insight:**

You're 62. Jean is 70 and retired. You've been at CIR for 16 years, in journalism for 36. You're not at the end yet, but the next chapter is visible. And when you think about retirement, you feel a pull between excitement and dread. Excitement: you're financially secure, you live in a beautiful city, you have time ahead. Dread: what the hell do you do when you're not a working journalist?

Here's the trap: thinking of retirement as "activities." Activities are fine—golf, travel, tennis—but they don't replace identity. What you need aren't more activities. You need micro-roles. Roles create rhythm, rhythm creates stability, stability protects sobriety.

A micro-role has three features: (1) a small recurring responsibility, (2) a defined cadence, and (3) a clear social footprint. Examples: host of a quarterly listening salon. Moderator of a monthly forum on investigative journalism trends. Doubles partner who shows up every Thursday. The role doesn't have to be ambitious. It has to be there.

The alternative is structureless freedom, which sounds great until you're three months in and you realize you haven't talked to anyone outside your household in a week. Structureless freedom, for you, is high-risk. It creates idle time, isolation, and a vacuum where "Michael the journalist" used to be. Alcohol filled that vacuum before. It will again if you don't design something better.

Your dad's model is instructive: he went deep into AA after he quit drinking. AA became a role. He had meetings, sponsees, responsibilities. It gave him structure. You don't need AA to be that thing, but you need something. A micro-role that says, "This is who I am now," not in a grand sense, but in a "this is what I do on Thursdays" sense.

Roles are metronomes. They give you a beat. When you have a beat, you're less likely to drift into the default mode: alone, idle, and thinking about drinking.

## Chapter 7: Awe at Dusk (Shrink the Self, Shrink the Urge)

**Core Insight:**

Awe is the opposite of rumination. When you're in awe, you're not thinking about whether you're adequate. You're not forecasting judgment. You're not managing the audience. You're just looking at something vast, old, or strange, and your self-concern shrinks.

Research shows awe reduces "self-focus"—the loop of thoughts about your own adequacy, reputation, and standing. For you, that loop is the engine of the audience problem. When you're caught in it, you're vulnerable. Alcohol promises to interrupt the loop. Awe actually does interrupt it, without the wreckage.

Three 12-15 minute awe walks per week at dusk. Not "walks where you might feel awe if you're lucky." Deliberate awe-seeking. You live near Buena Vista Park. The Pacific is an hour away. The Presidio, the Golden Gate at fog-line, the old Victorians on your street—all of these can evoke scale, age, strangeness. Your job is to look for it.

Dusk is the key time. It's the leading edge of your danger window. If you're walking at 5:45 PM, you're not at home deciding whether to drink. If you're looking at the fog rolling through the Gate, you're not in your head about work resentments. The walk doesn't "cure" the urge—it short-circuits the rumination that feeds the urge.

You've spent years using your body to prepare for panels (breathing exercises, warm-ups). This is the same principle: use your body to shift your mental state before the urge escalates. Awe walks are pre-urge hygiene.

## Chapter 8: Test-Ban (Two Sleeps)

**Core Insight:**

The "test the system" thought will appear. Not as a craving, not as a trigger—just as a thought. "What if I tried drinking moderately?" or "What if naltrexone means I could drink without consequences?" It will sound reasonable. It will sound like scientific curiosity.

It's not. It's the addiction testing the perimeter.

Two-sleep rule: if the test thought appears, you impose a 48-hour delay and tell one person. Text to safe person: "Testing thought popped up. 48-hour clock starts now." That's it. No explanation needed. The point isn't to have a conversation about whether you should test. The point is to make the thought no longer secret.

Time + witness dissolves impulses that rely on secrecy and speed. The testing thought wants you alone and in a hurry. The 48-hour delay removes "hurry." The witness removes "alone." At hour 47, the thought usually looks different. Not because you've talked yourself out of it, but because exposure killed its power.

If, after 48 hours, the thought still feels compelling, that's different. That's a signal to escalate—talk to someone, go to a meeting, revisit your recovery structure. But most testing thoughts don't survive two sleeps and one witness.

## Chapter 9: Map the Evening Terrain (Avoid Ambush Routes)

**Core Insight:**

You've walked into liquor stores on "one quick stop" pretexts. You've taken the route home that passes by the place you know sells your brand. You've created environments where relapse is one decision away. Ambush routes.

The alternative: safe routes and safe rooms. One route home that literally cannot pass a liquor store. One room-routine (6-6:30 PM) where the room itself tells you what to do next.

Example: you come home at 5:45. You walk to the kitchen (not your office). You drink a glass of water at the counter. You text Jean or one person. You go to the living room and put on a jazz record. At 6:05, you start dinner prep. The sequence is boring. That's the point. Boring is safe.

Compare that to: come home, go to your office, sit at your desk, "just check email," feel the pull, argue with yourself for ten minutes, lose the argument, drive to the liquor store. That's the ambush. You put yourself in the high-risk room (your office, the "den of destruction") with no competing routine.

Your office is where you drank. It's where the pattern lives. If you go there between 5 and 7 PM, you're re-entering the scene. That doesn't mean you can never use your office—it means you need a 5-7 PM room-substitute until the pattern weakens.

Redesign the environment so your feet help your mind. Feet don't argue. They just go where they're trained to go. Train them to go to the safe room, the safe route, the safe sequence.

## Chapter 10: Frame-Keeper (Medication as Ritual)

**Core Insight:**

Oral naltrexone is pharmacology, yes. But it's also a daily oath. You're taking it at 2 PM (or whatever consistent early-afternoon time you choose), and when you swallow it, you're not just blocking opioid receptors. You're saying: "I'm keeping the frame."

Not "I'm preventing a relapse." That keeps you in the problem-space. "I'm keeping the frame" orients you toward the version of yourself you're building. The frame is: I'm a man who doesn't drink. I'm 62, I'm building a post-career life, I'm repairing my marriage, I'm showing up. The pill is the daily re-commitment to that frame.

Pair it with the 4:55 hand-off. Naltrexone at 2 PM (before the danger window) + hand-off script at 4:55 PM (at the danger window's edge). Two rituals, two bookends, one system. The naltrexone says, "I've set the frame." The hand-off says, "I'm walking through the danger window inside that frame."

The point isn't only pharmacology—it's framing. You've taken naltrexone inconsistently in the past because you saw it as a fail-safe, something you'd take if you felt shaky. That's not how it works best. It works best when it's non-negotiable, like brushing your teeth. You don't brush your teeth only when you feel cavity-prone. You brush them because you've decided: that's part of who I am.

Same with naltrexone. You take it because you've decided: I'm someone who keeps the frame.

If you miss a dose, you don't spiral into shame. You just take the next one and say: "Frame's back." That's it. Missed doses are data, not moral failures. They tell you: this is a high-risk day, so shore up the other supports (meetings, texts, safe routes).

**Note:** These revised chapters draw extensively from Michael's actual session transcripts, using his language ("getting lost," "audience problem," "frame-keeper," "den of destruction"), real examples (homecoming banquet, Sarajevo, college reunion dreams, debt lies), and his actual patterns (5-8pm window, secret drinking, compartmentalization as survival mechanism from alcoholic household). The tone is journalist-friendly, precise, non-shaming, and pragmatic—matching both the brief and Michael's communication style.
