# AI Chat Bug Fix - October 1, 2025

## Problem
The AI chat feature was displaying "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again." for all messages.

## Root Cause
The `ai-chat.js` file was attempting to call the Groq API **directly from the browser**, which failed due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. Most AI API providers don't allow direct browser requests for security reasons.

## Solution
Modified the architecture to use a **proxy server pattern**:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `ai-chat.js`**
   - Removed direct Groq API calls from the browser
   - Changed to call local endpoint `/ai/chat` instead
   - Removed hardcoded API key from client-side code

2. **Updated `example-server.js`**
   - Added new `/ai/chat` endpoint to proxy chat requests
   - Server handles Groq API authentication server-side
   - Supports fallback to OpenAI API if Groq unavailable
   - Added mock mode for testing without API keys

3. **Updated `example-server.py`**
   - Added equivalent `/ai/chat` endpoint for Python users
   - Same proxy functionality as Node.js version

4. **Updated `package.json`**
   - Added `node-fetch` dependency for server-side HTTP requests

5. **Created `.env` file**
   - Moved API key to server-side environment variable
   - More secure than client-side exposure

## Setup Instructions

### To run the application:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify `.env` file exists with your API key:**
   ```bash
   cat .env
   # Should contain: GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Or: node example-server.js
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Test the chat:**
   - Type a message in the "Ask Anything" chat interface
   - Should receive a response from the AI

## Testing

The server is currently running on port 8000. You can test it by:
1. Opening http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Using the AI chat interface at the bottom of the page
3. Sending a test message like "testing"

## Security Improvements

- ✅ API keys now stored server-side in `.env` file
- ✅ API keys never exposed to client browser
- ✅ CORS issues resolved through proxy pattern
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## Files Modified
- `ai-chat.js` - Updated to use proxy endpoint
- `example-server.js` - Added /ai/chat proxy endpoint
- `example-server.py` - Added /ai/chat proxy endpoint
- `package.json` - Added node-fetch dependency
- `config.js` - Deprecated, API keys moved to .env
- `.env` - Created with GROQ_API_KEY

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - AI chat is now fully functional when server is running
