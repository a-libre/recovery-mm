# Recovery Reflections â€” Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ Everything's Done

This is a private, single-page reading experience for Michael Montgomery with:

1. **10 substantive chapters** drawn from real session transcripts
2. **AI chat integration** with full context from all recovery sessions
3. **Beautiful, minimal design** that works offline
4. **All interactive features** working (highlighting, notes, AI prompts)

---

## How to Use

### Main Page
1. Open `index.html` in any browser
2. Read through chapters in order or jump around using navigation
3. Highlight any sentence â†’ "Save as Resonant"
4. Click "Jot 3 Sentences" to write reflections
5. All data saves locally (nothing leaves your device)

### AI Chat
1. **Click the blue chat button** (bottom-right corner)
2. **Ask anything** - the AI has context from all your sessions:
   - "Why do I compartmentalize?"
   - "What's the connection between the audience problem and secrecy?"
   - "How do I talk to Jean about needing space without lying?"
   - "Explain the 4:55 transition"
   - "What should I do about retirement planning?"

The AI responds like a thoughtful colleague who's read all your session transcripts. Direct, not therapeutic. Journalist-to-journalist.

## What's in Each Chapter

**Chapter 1: The Audience Problem**
Homecoming banquet, Sarajevo impostor syndrome, evaluation anxiety. The grading system is mostly forecasted, not real.

**Chapter 2: The 4:55 Transition**
State transition problem. Naltrexone at 2pm. Gym/walk at 4:55. The gap between day-you and evening-you needs structure.

**Chapter 3: "Getting Lost"**
Legitimate need for amnesty from role-demands. Visible solitude vs secret amnesty. "I need 15 minutes alone" is an adult sentence.

**Chapter 4: Secrecy as Competence Protection**
Debt lies, drinking lies, withholding to look adequate. "I almost didn't mention X because I worried it would make me look Y."

**Chapter 5: From Niche to Social**
Russian, jazz, narrow beats = comparison control. Listening salon model. Curate, don't perform. Quarterly, not monthly.

**Chapter 6: Retirement Structure**
Roles > activities. Metronomes, not hobbies. Dad's AA model. "What do I do on Thursdays?" Structureless freedom = high risk.

**Chapter 7: Dusk Walks**
Awe shrinks self-focus. Three walks/week at 5:45. Buena Vista, Presidio, Golden Gate fog. Prevents rumination that feeds urges.

**Chapter 8: The Testing Thought**
"What if I tried moderate drinking?" = addiction testing perimeter. 48-hour delay + tell one person. Text: "Testing thought popped up. Clock starts now."

**Chapter 9: Safe Routes, Safe Rooms**
Office = "den of destruction" 5-7pm. Safe route home (no liquor stores). Safe room-routine: Kitchen â†’ water â†’ text â†’ living room â†’ jazz â†’ dinner.

**Chapter 10: Naltrexone as Frame-Keeper**
Daily oath at 2pm. "I'm keeping the frame." Not fail-safe for shaky days. Non-negotiable like brushing teeth. Missed dose? "Frame's back."

## AI Chat Examples

Try these to see how the AI works:

### Understanding Patterns
- "What drives my drinking?"
- "Why is the 5-8pm window so risky?"
- "How does compartmentalization work?"

### Specific Situations
- "Jean's upset that I'm not being honest. What do I say?"
- "I feel like I've caused too much damage. What's the point?"
- "Work deadline tonight, feeling anxious about it"

### Practical Guidance
- "Design my 4:55 ritual"
- "What should my listening salon look like?"
- "Help me think through retirement structure"

### Deep Dives
- "Connect the audience problem to my secrecy"
- "Why do I feel like an impostor?"
- "What's really happening when I want to get lost?"

The AI will respond directly, using your language, referencing specific things from sessions (Sarajevo, Jean, Beau, circuit workout, CIR, etc.).

## Technical Details

### Files
- `index.html` - Main page
- `styles.css` - All styling
- `app.js` - Core interactivity (highlighting, notes, data)
- `ai-chat.js` - Groq API integration with full session context

### AI Configuration
- **Model:** llama-3.1-70b-versatile (via Groq)
- **Context:** ~2000 words from all session transcripts
- **Tone:** Direct, journalist-friendly, non-therapeutic
- **History:** Saved to localStorage, persists between sessions

### Data Storage
- Everything local (localStorage)
- Highlights, notes, reflections, chat history
- Export as JSON anytime (footer button)
- Nothing sent to servers except AI chat (Groq API only)

### Offline Support
- Works offline except AI chat (requires internet)
- Fallback prompts if AI unavailable
- Pre-baked chapter content

---

## Privacy

- No tracking, no analytics, no cookies
- All personal data stays on your device
- Only AI chat calls external API (Groq)
- Chat conversations include session context but nothing you write is stored on servers
- Can use in private/incognito mode

---

## Customization

If you want to change anything:

### Add More Content
Edit chapter content directly in `index.html` (search for `<div class="insight">`).

### Change AI Behavior
Edit system prompt in `ai-chat.js` (starting line 7).

### Adjust Styling
Colors, fonts, spacing all in `styles.css` CSS custom properties at top.

### Add New Chapters
Copy an existing `<article class="chapter">` block, change IDs, update navigation.

## Support

If something doesn't work:
1. Check browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Make sure you're opening `index.html` (not viewing the file)
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari all work)
4. Clear localStorage if data seems stuck: `localStorage.clear()` in console

For AI chat issues:
- Check internet connection
- Verify Groq API key is valid (in `ai-chat.js` line 5)
- Look for CORS errors in console

## What Makes This Different

**Not a dashboard.** Not a tracker. Not a workbook.

It's a thoughtful, text-first reading experience with:
- Real insights from your actual sessions
- Direct tone (no therapy-speak)
- Interactive AI that knows your patterns
- Beautiful typography you actually want to read
- Respect for your intelligence

The content isn't generic recovery advice. It's specific to:
- Your audience problem
- Your compartmentalization history
- Your relationship with Jean
- Your work at CIR
- Your 5-8pm window
- Your dad's recovery model
- Your language ("getting lost," "frame-keeper," etc.)

---

## That's It

Open `index.html`. Read. Highlight. Write. Chat with AI. Come back whenever.

Your data stays local. Your recovery is yours.
