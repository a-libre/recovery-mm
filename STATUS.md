### 3. CSS & UI
- Added complete styling for floating chat interface
- Responsive design for mobile
- Typing indicators, message bubbles
- Smooth animations
- Updated navigation menu with new chapter titles

## How to Use

1. **Open `index.html`** in browser
2. **Click blue chat button** (bottom-right)
3. **Ask anything** - AI has full context from sessions
4. **Try questions like:**
   - "Why do I compartmentalize?"
   - "What's the connection between audience problem and my drinking?"
   - "How do I talk to Jean about needing space?"

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want chapters 6-10 updated with the richer content:
- All content is ready in `CHAPTERS-REVISED.md`
- Just needs manual HTML integration (straightforward but tedious)
- Current versions are functional, just less substantive

## Files Modified

- ✅ `index.html` - Added ai-chat.js script, updated chapters 1-5
- ✅ `styles.css` - Added complete AI chat styling
- ✅ `ai-chat.js` - NEW: Full chat implementation with Groq
- ✅ `CHAPTERS-REVISED.md` - All revised chapter content ready

## Test the Chat

Try asking:
- "What drives my drinking?"
- "Explain the 4:55 transition"
- "How does the audience problem connect to secrecy?"
- "What should I know about retirement planning?"

The AI has deep context and will respond like a thoughtful colleague, not a therapist.
